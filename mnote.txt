Need to make the thing do:
- [ ] Run gh to find all corp related tickets and close or update
- [ ] Run git commit on the code after it compiles
- [ ] Make the tests for all the new code
- [ ] Make the AI bot aware of new cmds so need to have it published by the server
- [ ] Update the PROTOCOL.v2.md documentation to include the new JSON
- [ ] Might need to look at breaking this document up into files for easier editing. 
- [ ] Make the client have a corp menu
