  Summary of ALL Lost Fixes / Functionality (across all issues reviewed so far):

Recently there was a problem where some functionality was lost, and some was "potentially" lost. I want you to invetigate if some functionlity has been lost. Do NOT change anything. I just need you to investigate and report back to me.

|   5. Issue 150: "One SQLite connection per worker thread (open with SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX) and drop the global mutex."
|       * Problem: The architectural change to use thread-local SQLite connections (__thread sqlite3 *tls_db = NULL; with SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX) and remove the global mutex has not been implemented. The global db_handle and
|         pthread_mutex_lock are still in use throughout database.c.
|       * Impact: The server's database access remains single-threaded or less performant than intended, potentially leading to bottlenecks under load.
|       * Recommendation: Re-implement the thread-local SQLite connection model as described in the issue.

|   6. Issue 142: "Add db error handling to all rollback calls in all db functions"
|       * Problem: The explicit check and logging of the rollback's return code are not consistently implemented after sqlite3_exec(db, "ROLLBACK", ...) calls.
|       * Impact: Rollback failures might occur silently without proper logging, hindering debugging and potentially leaving the database in an inconsistent state.
|       * Recommendation: Implement consistent error checking and logging for all ROLLBACK calls.

│ I have reviewed all instances of `sqlite3_exec(db, "ROLLBACK", ...)` and `sqlite3_exec(db, "ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT", ...)` calls in `src/database.c`. In every identified case, the return code from `sqlite3_exec`                         │
│ is not captured or explicitly checked for `SQLITE_OK`, and no error logging specific to the rollback operation itself is performed.                                                                                                        │

│ This means that if a `ROLLBACK` or `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` operation were to fail (e.g., due to an I/O error, database corruption, or other SQLite internal issues), the failure would occur silently. The function                        │
│  would typically proceed as if the rollback was successful, or return an error code reflecting the *original* issue that triggered the rollback, not the rollback's failure itself.                                                        │

=============================



  1. Implement Caching for Online Player List

   * Detail: This involves storing the online player list, or portions of it, directly in the server's memory. Instead of hitting the database for every player.list_online request, the server would serve cached data. This typically
     includes a thread-safe data structure for the cached data, a timestamp for freshness, and a mechanism to refresh the cache (periodically or upon relevant events like logins/logouts). get_online_players_json_array would be modified to
     check this cache first.

   * Why you might want it:
       * Performance: Dramatically reduces database load and speeds up response times for frequent player.list_online requests.
       * Scalability: Allows the server to handle more concurrent requests efficiently without overwhelming the database.
       * Resource Efficiency: Minimizes CPU and I/O usage from repetitive database queries.

   * Considerations: Adds architectural complexity regarding cache coherence and invalidation. Consumes server memory. Requires careful management of data staleness versus freshness.

  2. Consider Security/Access Control for Sensitive Fields

   * Detail: This improvement implements a layer of authorization to control which client-requested fields in a player's data are actually returned. Based on the requesting client's identity, role, or relationship to the target player,
     certain "sensitive" fields (e.g., specific stats, location data, or private financial details) would be withheld or modified.
       * Mechanism: Involves defining clear roles and permissions for different types of clients (e.g., regular player, admin, faction leader). When db_player_info_selected_fields (or an adjacent layer) processes the effective_fields, it
         would perform a permission check for each field against the requesting client_ctx_t. Fields without appropriate permissions would be filtered out.

   * Why you might want it:
       * Data Privacy: Safeguards sensitive player data from unauthorized access, building user trust and complying with privacy standards.
       * Game Balance/Anti-Cheat: Prevents exploitation by denying access to information that could offer an unfair gameplay advantage.
       * System Integrity: Ensures only privileged users can access highly sensitive operational data.
       * API Granularity: Provides a more secure and controlled API experience, where data exposure is precisely managed.

   * Considerations: Increases complexity in authorization logic and permission management. Requires careful design to avoid performance overhead from granular checks. Needs a robust system to define and configure sensitive fields and
     their associated access policies.

  Both caching and security are crucial for a robust, scalable, and secure application. Do you have more questions, or would you like to proceed with one of these?
