Current things todo:
[] Ensure all the commanline options for bigbang are working
[] Change the string pop function to allow character strings of
   variable sizes.



Possible future enhancements, which the original game lacked.


- create the ships listed in the stardock library so that people can
  find them

- upgrade cidadel above level 6. 
	* Allow planet cloaking.
	* Allow funds transfer between cidadels
	* transport colonists between planets.

- have a built in "best trade" system in computer which will show you
  paired ports from the places you have already visited 

- Give users the ability to write a "module" to add in other aliens,
  ships, etc without having to hack code. Possibly a perl or python
  type interface, or maybe simple XML definitions.

- Create a "master server" which all launched servers will report
  themselves to. (Similar to Quake) Modify the server to allow the
  user to define the master server to report to. Have a default value
  for the master server. The server would update the master server on
  start up and every 24 hours. The Master would then be able to
  produce a report similar to the one below from the original game as
  an HTML page for each reported server.
