- [ ] WITHOUT MAKING ANY CHANGES, review the code in src/ and the database schema in hold/fullschema.sql and compare it against the test cases in the tests/ directory. These tests should still be valid, assuming nothing has been lost. The files to check are:
armid_mine_tests.json
bank_and_trade_tests.json
genesis_torpedo_tests.json
shipyard_tests.json
stardock_tests.json
tavern_tests.json
tests_all.json


- [ ] WITHOUT MAKING ANY CHANGES, check the code and schema against the implementation plan implementation_plan.md and make sure all functions are complete. List anything not yet completed. 
- [ ] Make the tests in the tests subdirectory for corporation json cmds for all the new code
- [ ] In order to make the AI bot aware of new cmds they must be published by the server, ensure all implmented cmds are being published properly
- [ ] Update the PROTOCOL.v2.md documentation to include the new JSON and cmds with examples. 
- [ ] Make the client in the client/ subdirectory have a corp menu
